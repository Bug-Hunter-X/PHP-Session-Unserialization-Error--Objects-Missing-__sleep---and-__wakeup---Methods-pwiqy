This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug related to session handling and object serialization. When unserializing session data containing objects without properly implemented  `__sleep()` and `__wakeup()` magic methods, unexpected behavior or fatal errors can occur.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version. The issue is described in more detail within the files themselves.
