To rectify this, ensure that any object stored in the session implements both `__sleep()` and `__wakeup()` methods.  `__sleep()` should return an array of object properties to serialize, allowing you to selectively exclude sensitive or resource-dependent data. `__wakeup()` can then handle any necessary re-initialization or reconnection to external resources after unserialization.  For example:

```php
class MyClass {
    private $db;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->db = new PDO('...'); // Database connection
    }

    public function __sleep() {
        return ['db']; // Only serialize this property
    }

    public function __wakeup() {
        $this->db = new PDO('...'); // Reconnect to the database
    }
}
```
By implementing these magic methods, you ensure that the object's state is properly handled during serialization and unserialization, preventing errors and resource issues.
