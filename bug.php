In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with sessions and unserialization. If the session data contains objects that have not implemented the __sleep() and __wakeup() magic methods, unserializing the session data can lead to unexpected behavior or even fatal errors. This is because PHP's unserialization process might not know how to handle the object's state, resulting in data loss or corruption.  For instance, if an object holds database connections or file handles, unserializing it without proper handling could lead to resource leaks or inconsistencies.
